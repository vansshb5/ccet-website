        Academics is central to the overall development of a student. The
        classes allow diverse groups of people to compete and perform to the
        peak of their potential, growing towards excellence. The academic
        scores achieved by the students of an institute are testimony of the
        quality of the courses offered and the dedication of the faculty
        imparting it. The high standards of inputs being poured by the vibrant
        teachers and the outputs by the hard working students have bore out
        excellent results, as shown by the fact that the university topper for
        the year 2003-2004 for BE was from CCET (DG).
